## The Nutcracker story

_"The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"_ is a story written in 1816 by German author E. T. A. Hoffmann, in which young Clara’s favorite Christmas toy, the Nutcracker, comes alive and after defeating the evil Mouse King in battle, whisks her away to a magical kingdom populated by dolls.

It is Christmas Eve at the Stahlbaum house -- A large and grand house with the most beautiful tree imaginable.  The Stahlbaums are hosting their annual Christmas party, welcoming the arrival of their family and friends.  The children, Clara and Fritz, are dancing and playing as they welcome their friends too. The party grows festive with music and dance as godfather Drosselmeyer arrives.  

Drosselmeyer is a skilled clock and toy maker and always full of surprises. He draws everyone's attention as he presents two life-size dolls.  They are the delight of the party, each taking a turn to dance. The children begin to open gifts when Drosselmeyer presents his to Clara and Fritz.  Although his gift to Fritz is quite nice, he gives Clara a beautiful Nutcracker that  becomes the hit of the party.

Fritz becomes jealous and, having a bit more spunk than a boy should have, grabs the nutcracker from Clara and promptly breaks it.  Clara is heartbroken looking on as Drosselmeyer quickly repairs the Nutcracker with a handkerchief he magically draws from the air.

As the evening grows late, the guests depart and the Stahlbaum family retires for the evening.  Clara, worried about her beloved Nutcracker, sneaks back to the tree to check on him, falling asleep with him in her arms.

Being more than a beloved Christmas story, the Nutcracker is our source of inspiration for this year’s Christmas.

    The Nutcracker is an iconic figure and symbolizes the hero who protects those who need to.
